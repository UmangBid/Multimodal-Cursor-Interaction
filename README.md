# Multimodal-Cursor-Interaction
An innovative AI-powered system designed to revolutionize computer interaction by integrating hand gesture recognition, eye gaze tracking, and voice command control. This project uses advanced technologies like OpenCV, MediaPipe, Dlib, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a seamless and cost-effective alternative to traditional input devices. Achieving 95% gesture recognition accuracy and real-time response within 100ms, the system delivers precision, accessibility, and ease of use. With over 100 user testing sessions and 80% positive feedback, it is tailored for users with mobility impairments and offers versatile applications in accessibility, gaming, and human-computer interaction research. Perfect for anyone looking to explore multimodal interaction systems and advanced interface designs.
